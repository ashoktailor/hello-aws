4. install terraform:

    b. create a downloads folder in your environment and download and unzip terraform using wget:
    
        $ wget <link address for download>
        $ unzip terraform...amd64.zip
        
    c. update PATH so we can call terraform binary. edit .bash_profile and add to end of file:
    
        export PATH=$HOME/environment/downloads:$PATH
    
    d. might need to open new shell to pick up new PATH
    
    e. check installation by running:
    
        $ terraform --version
        
5. test terraform

    a. follow tutorial here to create an ec2 instance - https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/build

6. tell Git to ignore certain terraform files and directories 

    a. open /.git/info/exclude
    
    b. add following lines
    
        terraform.tfstate
        terraform.tfstate.backup
        /terraform/*

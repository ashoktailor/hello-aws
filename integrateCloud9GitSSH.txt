this file explains the steps to integrate my Cloud9 environment with a Git repository using ssh

1. create Cloud9 environment which will have Git installed.  to check if Git is installed run:

    $ git --version
    
2. generate an RSA key pair in your Cloud9 environment.

    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa
    
   note: enter full pathname of file when prompted i.e. 
   
    >> /home/ec2-user/.ssh/id_rsa
    
3. copy your newly generated Public key.  i.e. open /home/ec2-user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

4. goto Github >> Settings >> SSH and GPS keys and add a new key with the content from previous step.

5. back in Cloud9 environment, start ssh-agent and add ssh key:

    $ eval $(ssh-agent -s)
    $ ssh-add /home/ec2-user/.ssh/id_rsa
    
6. back in Github, 
    a. navigate to the repository you wish to clone in Cloud9 
    b. press the green  "Clone or download" button
    c. check that you've selected "Clone with ssh"
    d. copy the URL

7. back to Cloud9, open a terminal and type:

    $ git clone git@github.com:<YOUR RESPOSITORY NAME>
    
Next steps

    - not sure if I need to start the ssh-agent each time I open my Cloud9 environment?
